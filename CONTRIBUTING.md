# Contributing

Pull requests welcomed. Please ensure you create your edits in a branch off of the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.

## Reference Website

Please test your changes against the reference websites (Both Umbraco 6 and 7). Umbraco admin password is:

```
  User: admin
  Pass: admin
```

Note that the `ReferenceWebsite[Umbraco7]\App_Data\Umbraco.sdf` _should_ be included in version control such that
new databases don't have to be created
