        <description>Vault for Umbraco is an easy-to-use, extensible ORM to quickly and easily get strongly-typed Umbraco CMS data into your views. It allows you to create lightly-decorated classes that Vault will understand how to hydrate. This gives you the full view model-style experience in Umbraco that you are accustomed to in MVC, complete with strongly-typed view properties (no more magic strings in your views).</description>
