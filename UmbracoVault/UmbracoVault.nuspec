        <description>Vault for Umbraco is an easy-to-use, extensible ORM to quickly and easily get strongly-typed Umbraco CMS data into your views. It allows you to create lightly-decorated classes that Vault will understand how to hydrate. This gives you the full view model-style experience in Umbraco that you are accustomed to in MVC, complete with strongly-typed view properties (no more magic strings in your views).</description>

        <releaseNotes>
          *New Feature: Lazy Loading*

          Umbraco Vault now includes support for lazy loading of properties. Properties that are expensive to hydrate,
          such as collections, can be marked as `virtual` and they will be loaded when accessed. See <TBD> article
for more detail on this feature.

*Other*

 * Codebase has been updated to build against VS 2015 and C# 6
 * Reference sites for testing builds have been updated to the latest v6 and v7 versions, including ASP.Net MVC5
 * Various internal accessiblity changes have been made to limit exposure of the API
 * Various code cleanup
